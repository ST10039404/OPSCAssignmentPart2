so not all these files are important if you're looking to get the code, the important ones are:

for the coding files it's app/src/main/java/com/example/opscassignmentpart2, and then the stuff in there, i hope its not too spaghetti
https://github.com/ST10039404/OPSCAssignmentPart2/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/opscassignmentpart2

for the other stuff (like the styles and the layouts) it should be the OPSCAssignmentPart2/app/src/main/res/
just the drawable, layout and values folders have stuff i did in them.
